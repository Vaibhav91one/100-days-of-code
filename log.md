# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 31, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some problems on arrays.

**Thoughts:** Did some problems of arrays that I had in my codelist, I got stuck on rotate the array. I did solve the problem but got stuck on optimizing it. I did find a Juggling algorithm to optimize the solution. Will look into it.
