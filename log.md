# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 31, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some problems on arrays.

**Thoughts:** Did some problems of arrays that I had in my codelist, I got stuck on rotate the array. I did solve the problem but got stuck on optimizing it. I did find a Juggling algorithm to optimize the solution. Will look into it.

### Day 2: August 01, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the problem of Rotation.

**Thoughts:** I was not able to understand the logic well at the first look, but after some focus I was able to grasp about 50% of what was happening, the other 50% I was able to grasp by testing what was happening and voila. later I also did the same problem on leetcode but the rotation was for right. And it was surprisingly easy. I have updated the repo and commented my thoughts. That's 1 hour see you next day.
